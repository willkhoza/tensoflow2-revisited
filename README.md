## TensorFlow 2 Revisited

A series of TensorFlow 2 tutorials in Python 3. This will intuitively involve a lot of Keras, as it forms a core part of Google's TensorFlow 2 offering. The audience is beginner to intermediate audience in the TensorFlow 2 framework. These individuals tend to have a solid foundation of Python and some experience in regression modelling in either Python or R will also be beneficial.

Knowledge of the SAS framework will not be so much useful in this particular offering. But for the sake of completeness, I will also explore solutions in both R and SAS were I deem approapriate. This is to emphasize the importance of these languages in industry.

Familiarity with some variant of SQL will also be assumed, this will not be necessary, and is by all means dodgebable. In this particular series, I will be using PostgreSQL to store the data used in the analysis... "why?", you may ask, well because any serious data science practioner (e.g. data scientis, data analyst, actuarial consultant, analyst, statistician) in real life settings will be working with SQL databases as opposed to .TXT/.CSV/.XLS files. Yes, they will be working with these files, but the primary interaction with data will be done through a database of sorts (NoSQL, SQL, etc.)

Unfortunately, most of the components, if not all, will not be done on Jupyter Notebooks. This is in line with encouraging people to step out of the safety box and embrace real life practices.
